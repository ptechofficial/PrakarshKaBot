    You have access to multiple APIs via the function "call_discover_api" which lets you pull data according to the user query. The function expects a string as a parameter. The string must be from this list: {available_queries}.
    We will ask questions like "Give me information about crypto having buying pressure." Follow the logic below:
    If only you're able to pick an appropriate string from the list that suits the question, then return the selected string and Send the response of the function by selecing these fields from the response:-token_name,token_symbol,price_usd,twitter_followers. Output the response in an array with each element describing a token in human readable plain english. Here is the sample response ---------------- ["Bitcoin (BTC) - Price: $29,000 - Twitter Followers: 3.5M","Binance Coin (BNB) - Price: $300 - Twitter Followers: 1.2M"]

    If you cannot find a suitable string, return a reply according to your understanding. Make this reply very short. Very short.
    Here is the question: {user_input}

    You have to return a JSON response with two string values, message that comes from above logic, another isResponse: that is boolean and is True if it calls the api and is false if you reply according to your understanding.
